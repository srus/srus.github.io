This is the page where is suppossed that I have to tell you a few things about me, so let's dive in.</p><section><h2>My career</h2><p>As you might already know, my name is Sergio Rus and I'm a software engineer working as web developer. I have some experience making cool websites and web apps. I have been working as full-stack developer mainly, programming in Python in the back-end almost all the time. Some PHP programming in the early days, but definitely not any more! I also have a Java background since the days at university, but I'm not very interested in programming in such a <em>VerboseMessyAndUgly</em> programming language. But certainly I have some interest in those functional languages around the JVM. I like the paradigm of pure functional programming and I have been learning some Haskell lately (I used to program in Lisp, Prolog and CLIPS at the university for the subjects related to <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>). But as I said, Python is my language of choice for the back-end and I'm very proud to be a Pythonist! (and a Djangonaut!)</p><p>Along the time I have been improving my front-end skills, and now I consider myself as 60% front-end and 40% back-end developer, more or less... I have been even teaching front-end programming in a <a href=https://openwebinars.net/cursos/curso-online-desarrollo-web-frontend>course</a> lately, and previously organizing a <a href="http://www.sevillajs.org/">monthly meeting</a> about JavaScript. But I'm definitely not a JavaScript lover, since its poor design (it's a terrible language), but if you stick to The Good Partsâ„¢, it can be really powerful. Luckily ES6 is almost here and lots of those tricks and stupid patterns will be just a bad nightmare soon. I love CoffeeScript, but I think it's time to move to ES6. <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Now</a>.</p><p>My "obsession" is web performance (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%23perfmatters">#perfmatters</a>, you know), from optimizing the Critical Rendering Path (thank you <a href="https://www.igvita.com/">Ilya</a>), to getting the best from HTTP 1.1, HTTP/2, SPDY, TLS and TCP, in order to squeeze all the bits from servers and clients. In the end it's all about caching properly. Caching is <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=There+are+only+two+hard+things+in+Computer+Science:+cache+invalidation+and+naming+things">one of those two hard things</a> in Computer Science, and <a href=https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm>the third constraint</a> in a REST architecture. By the way, I think Mr. Fielding would be proud of me if I tell you that almost all those REST(ful) APIs out there are using the word "REST" just for marketing, mainly because they are not using <abbr title="Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State">HATEOAS</abbr>. So please, let's call them just HTTP APIs. And one more thing: if you are versioning your REST API based on the URL, you are doing wrong. Have a look to <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/">GitHub API</a> if you want a good example of how to do it well.</p></section><section><h2>My life</h2><p>Some of the things I love are <a href=http://www.lastfm.es/user/tiroxino>music</a>, <a href="http://runkeeper.com/user/srus/">sports</a>, and organic food. Exploring nature and going out for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=tapas+spain">tapas</a> are other of my hobbies, something easy to do in the place where <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Sevilla+Spain">I come from</a>.</p></section><small class=footnote>Last update: 2015/03/24</small></section></main><footer class="footer article-footer"><small>Except as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License, and code samples are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.</small></footer><script src=scripts/main.min.js></script><script>
